	<h2>1. Introduce Pomander to your project</h2>
	<p>This will give you a deploy folder and a development.php environment to get you started.</p>
	<pre class="terminal"><code data-language="shell">
$ pom init
	</code></pre>
	<p>The environment <code>development</code> is assumed to be your local machine and will act as such. This gives you the ability to automate your development environment to get up and running more easily.</p>
	<p>If you want to deploy to a server, read on to step 2!</p>

<section class="annotate">
	<h2>2. Configure your environments</h2>
	<p>Create as many environments as you like, and name them as you please. Stuff like <em>staging</em> and <em>production</em> are great, but you can really do whatever you would like.</p>
	<pre class="terminal"><code data-language="shell">
$ touch deploy/experiment.php
	</code></pre>
	<p>Pomander is flexible enough to work with your environment.</p>
	<pre><code data-language="php">
&lt;?php
  $env->user('deploy')
      ->repository('git&#x0040;github.com&#58;tamagokun/mikey-kong.git')
      ->deploy_to('/var/www/html')

$ pom staging deploy:setup
